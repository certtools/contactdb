History
=======
This project started in our spare time. 
It is closely related to the IHAP project, [intelmq](http://intelmq.org) and incident handling topics in general.

It then added code done by [Intevation GmbH for BSI in 2016](https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq/tree/certbund-contact).
Furthermore this code was enhanced by change requests from CERT.at and added specific fields for personal contact data.
